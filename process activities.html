            Real software processes are interleaved sequences of technical, collaborative, and
managerial activities with the overall goal of specifying, designing, implementing,
and testing a software system. Software developers use a variety of different software
tools in their work. Tools are particularly useful for supporting the editing of different
types of document and for managing the immense volume of detailed information
that is generated in a large software project.
The four basic process activities of specification, development, validation, and evolution are organized differently in different development processes. In the waterfall
model, they are organized in sequence, whereas in incremental development they are
interleaved. How these activities are carried out depends on the type of software,
people, and organizational structures involved. In extreme programming, for example,
specifications are written on cards. Tests are executable and developed before the
program itself. Evolution may involve substantial system restructuring or refactoring.
    </p> <br><br>

       <h2> <center>2.2.1 Software specification</h2></center>
    
    
    
   <p>The first published model of the software development process was derived from
    more general system engineering processes (Royce, 1970). This model is illustrated
    in Figure 2.1. Because of the cascade from one phase to another, this model is known
    as the ‘waterfall model’ or software life cycle. The waterfall model is an example of
    a plan-driven process—in principle, you must plan and schedule all of the process
    activities before starting work on them.</p>

    <p>Software specification or requirements engineering is the process of understanding
        and defining what services are required from the system and identifying the constraints on the system’s operation and development. Requirements engineering is a</p>

      <center>  <img src="AA 111.png" alt=""></center>

      <p>particularly critical stage of the software process as errors at this stage inevitably
        lead to later problems in the system design and implementation. <br>
        The requirements engineering process (Figure 2.4) aims to produce an agreed
        requirements document that specifies a system satisfying stakeholder requirements.
        Requirements are usually presented at two levels of detail. End-users and customers
        need a high-level statement of the requirements; system developers need a more
        detailed system specification.</p> 
        <p>There are four main activities in the requirements engineering process:
        </p>
<ol>
<li>Feasibility study An estimate is made of whether the identified user needs may be
    satisfied using current software and hardware technologies. The study considers
    whether the proposed system will be cost-effective from a business point of view
    and if it can be developed within existing budgetary constraints. A feasibility
    study should be relatively cheap and quick. The result should inform the decision
    of whether or not to go ahead with a more detailed analysis.
    </li>
    <li>Requirements elicitation and analysis This is the process of deriving the system
        requirements through observation of existing systems, discussions with potential users and procurers, task analysis, and so on. This may involve the development of one or more system models and prototypes. These help you understand
        the system to be specified.</li>
        <li>Requirements specification Requirements specification is the activity of translating the information gathered during the analysis activity into a document that defines a set of requirements. Two types of requirements may be included in this
            document. User requirements are abstract statements of the system requirements for the customer and end-user of the system; system requirements are a
            more detailed description of the functionality to be provided.</li>


    

<center><img src="AA 222.png" alt=""></center>
<li>
     Requirements validation This activity checks the requirements for realism, consistency, and completeness. During this process, errors in the requirements document
are inevitably discovered. It must then be modified to correct these problems.

</li> </ol>
<p>Of course, the activities in the requirements process are not simply carried out in a
    strict sequence. Requirements analysis continues during definition and specification and
    new requirements come to light throughout the process. Therefore, the activities of
    analysis, definition, and specification are interleaved. In agile methods, such as extreme
    programming, requirements are developed incrementally according to user priorities and
    the elicitation of requirements comes from users who are part of the development team.
    </p>

    <h2> <center>2.2.2 Software design and implementation</h2></center>

    <center><img src="AA 333.png" alt=""></center>
    

<p>The diagram suggests that the stages of the design process are sequential. In fact,
    design process activities are interleaved. Feedback from one stage to another and
    consequent design rework is inevitable in all design processes.
    Most software interfaces with other software systems. These include the operating
    system, database, middleware, and other application systems. These make up the ‘software platform’, the environment in which the software will execute. Information about
    this platform is an essential input to the design process, as designers must decide how
    best to integrate it with the software’s environment. The requirements specification is a
    description of the functionality the software must provide and its performance and
    dependability requirements. If the system is to process existing data, then the description
    of that data may be included in the platform specification; otherwise, the data description
    must be an input to the design process so that the system data organization to be defined.
    The activities in the design process vary, depending on the type of system being
    developed. For example, real-time systems require timing design but may not
    include a database so there is no database design involved. Figure 2.5 shows four
    activities that may be part of the design process for information systems:
    </p>

    <ol>
        <li>Architectural design, where you identify the overall structure of the system, the
            principal components (sometimes called sub-systems or modules), their relationships, and how they are distributed.</li>
            <li>
                Interface design, where you define the interfaces between system components.
This interface specification must be unambiguous. With a precise interface, a
component can be used without other components having to know how it is
implemented. Once interface specifications are agreed, the components can be
designed and developed concurrently.

            </li>
    

   <center><img src="AA 444.png" alt=""> </center> 

<li>
    Component design, where you take each system component and design how it will
operate. This may be a simple statement of the expected functionality to be
implemented, with the specific design left to the programmer. Alternatively, it may
be a list of changes to be made to a reusable component or a detailed design model.
The design model may be used to automatically generate an implementation.

</li>
<li>
    Database design, where you design the system data structures and how these are
to be represented in a database. Again, the work here depends on whether an
existing database is to be reused or a new database is to be created.
</li>
</ol>
<p>These activities lead to a set of design outputs, which are also shown in Figure 2.5.
    The detail and representation of these vary considerably. For critical systems, detailed
    design documents setting out precise and accurate descriptions of the system must be
    produced. If a model-driven approach is used, these outputs may mostly be diagrams.
    Where agile methods of development are used, the outputs of the design process may not
    be separate specification documents but may be represented in the code of the program.
    Structured methods for design were developed in the 1970s and 1980s and were
    the precursor to the UML and object-oriented design (Budgen, 2003). They rely on
    producing graphical models of the system and, in many cases, automatically generating code from these models. Model-driven development (MDD) or model-driven
    engineering (Schmidt, 2006), where models of the software are created at different
    levels of abstraction, is an evolution of structured methods. In MDD, there is greater
    emphasis on architectural models with a separation between abstract implementationindependent models and implementation-specific models. The models are developed
    in sufficient detail so that the executable system can be generated from them. I discuss
    this approach to development in Chapter 5.
    The development of a program to implement the system follows naturally from the
    system design processes. Although some classes of program, such as safety-critical
    systems, are usually designed in detail before any implementation begins, it is more
    common for the later stages of design and program development to be interleaved.
    Software development tools may be used to generate a skeleton program from a
    design. This includes code to define and implement interfaces, and, in many cases, the
    developer need only add details of the operation of each program component.
    Programming is a personal activity and there is no general process that is usually
    followed. Some programmers start with components that they understand, develop
    these, and then move on to less-understood components. Others take the opposite
    </p>

    <center><img src="AA 555.png" alt=""></center>

    <p>approach, leaving familiar components till last because they know how to develop
        them. Some developers like to define data early in the process then use this to drive
        the program development; others leave data unspecified for as long as possible.
        Normally, programmers carry out some testing of the code they have developed. This
        often reveals program defects that must be removed from the program. This is called
        debugging. Defect testing and debugging are different processes. Testing establishes the
        existence of defects. Debugging is concerned with locating and correcting these defects.
        When you are debugging, you have to generate hypotheses about the observable
        behavior of the program then test these hypotheses in the hope of finding the fault that
        caused the output anomaly. Testing the hypotheses may involve tracing the program
        code manually. It may require new test cases to localize the problem. Interactive
        debugging tools, which show the intermediate values of program variables and a trace
        of the statements executed, may be used to support the debugging process.
        </p>

       
        <h2> <center>2.2.3 Software validation</h2></center>
<p>Software validation or, more generally, verification and validation (V&V) is
    intended to show that a system both conforms to its specification and that it meets
    the expectations of the system customer. Program testing, where the system is executed using simulated test data, is the principal validation technique. Validation may
    also involve checking processes, such as inspections and reviews, at each stage of the
    software process from user requirements definition to program development.
    Because of the predominance of testing, the majority of validation costs are incurred
    during and after implementation.
    Except for small programs, systems should not be tested as a single, monolithic
    unit. Figure 2.6 shows a three-stage testing process in which system components are
    tested then the integrated system is tested and, finally, the system is tested with the
    customer’s data. Ideally, component defects are discovered early in the process, and
    interface problems are found when the system is integrated. However, as defects are
    discovered, the program must be debugged and this may require other stages in the
    testing process to be repeated. Errors in program components, say, may come to light
    during system testing. The process is therefore an iterative one with information
    being fed back from later stages to earlier parts of the process.
    The stages in the testing process are:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>Development testing The components making up the system are tested by the
            people developing the system. Each component is tested independently, without
            other system components. Components may be simple entities such as functions or object classes, or may be coherent groupings of these entities. Test automation tools, such as JUnit (Massol and Husted, 2003), that can re-run component
            tests when new versions of the component are created, are commonly used.
            </li> 
            <li>System testing System components are integrated to create a complete system.
                This process is concerned with finding errors that result from unanticipated
                interactions between components and component interface problems. It is also
                concerned with showing that the system meets its functional and non-functional
                requirements, and testing the emergent system properties. For large systems,
                this may be a multi-stage process where components are integrated to form subsystems that are individually tested before these sub-systems are themselves
                integrated to form the final system.</li>
                <li>Acceptance testing This is the final stage in the testing process before the system
                    is accepted for operational use. The system is tested with data supplied by the
                    system customer rather than with simulated test data. Acceptance testing may
                    reveal errors and omissions in the system requirements definition, because the
                    real data exercise the system in different ways from the test data. Acceptance
                    testing may also reveal requirements problems where the system’s facilities do
                    not really meet the user’s needs or the system performance is unacceptable.  </li>
</ol>

<p>Normally, component development and testing processes are interleaved.
    Programmers make up their own test data and incrementally test the code as it is
    developed. This is an economically sensible approach, as the programmer knows the
    component and is therefore the best person to generate test cases.
    If an incremental approach to development is used, each increment should be
    tested as it is developed, with these tests based on the requirements for that increment. In extreme programming, tests are developed along with the requirements
    before development starts. This helps the testers and developers to understand the
    requirements and ensures that there are no delays as test cases are created.
    When a plan-driven software process is used (e.g., for critical systems development), testing is driven by a set of test plans. An independent team of testers works
    from these pre-formulated test plans, which have been developed from the system
    specification and design. Figure 2.7 illustrates how test plans are the link between
    testing and development activities. This is sometimes called the V-model of development (turn it on its side to see the V).
    Acceptance testing is sometimes called ‘alpha testing’. Custom systems are
    developed for a single client. The alpha testing process continues until the system
    developer and the client agree that the delivered system is an acceptable implementation of the requirements.
    When a system is to be marketed as a software product, a testing process called
    ‘beta testing’ is often used. Beta testing involves delivering a system to a number of
    potential customers who agree to use that system. They report problems to the system developers. This exposes the product to real use and detects errors that may not
    have been anticipated by the system builders. After this feedback, the system is modified and released either for further beta testing or for general sale.</p>

<h2> <center>2.2.4 Software evolution</h2></center>
<p>The flexibility of software systems is one of the main reasons why more and more
    software is being incorporated in large, complex systems. Once a decision has been
    made to manufacture hardware, it is very expensive to make changes to the hardware
    design. However, changes can be made to software at any time during or after the
    system development. Even extensive changes are still much cheaper than corresponding changes to system hardware.
    Historically, there has always been a split between the process of software development and the process of software evolution (software maintenance). People think
    of software development as a creative activity in which a software system is developed from an initial concept through to a working system. However, they sometimes
    think of software maintenance as dull and uninteresting. Although the costs of maintenance are often several times the initial development costs, maintenance processes
    are sometimes considered to be less challenging than original software development.
    This distinction between development and maintenance is increasingly irrelevant.
    Hardly any software systems are completely new systems and it makes much more
    sense to see development and maintenance as a continuum. Rather than two separate
    processes, it is more realistic to think of software engineering as an evolutionary
    process (Figure 2.8) where software is continually changed over its lifetime in
    response to changing requirements and customer needs.</p>
